I acquired knowledge and skills in several areas.
1. HTML: building the project foundation by using the power of HTML, employing <section> <div> elements for effective structuring.
2. CSS: Explore CSS styling techniques such as text-align, color, margin, padding and making it responsive with @media only screen rule.
